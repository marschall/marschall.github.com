title: PGJDBC now has JSR-310 Support
---

Version 9.4.1208 of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver (pgjdbc) just shipped. This is the first version to support [JSR-310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310) with JDBC 4.2. The supported JSR-310 data types are:


| PostgreSQLâ„¢                     | Java SE 8     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| DATE                            | LocalDate     |
| TIME [ WITHOUT TIME ZONE ]      | LocalTime     |
| TIMESTAMP [ WITHOUT TIME ZONE ] | LocalDateTime |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE        | OffsetTime    |


This is closely aligned with tables B-4 and B-5 of the JDBC 4.2 specification. Note that `ZonedDateTime`, `Instant` and `OffsetTime / TIME [ WITHOUT TIME ZONE ]` are not supported. Also note that all `OffsetDateTime` instances will have be in UTC (have offset 0). This is because the backend stores them as UTC.
Besides various data types from tables B-4 and B-5 as well as `PGobject` subtypes are supported.

You can use the API like this:

```java
try (Statement st = conn.createStatement();  
    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE columnfoo = 500")) {
    while (rs.next()) {
        LocalDate localDate = rs.getObject(1, LocalDate.class);
        System.out.println(localDate);
    }
}
```

The PostgreSQL driver documentation should soon be updated to reflect this.

If you're using Maven the coordinates are:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
  <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
  <version>9.4.1208</version>
</dependency>
```
