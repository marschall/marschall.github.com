title: PGJDBC now has JSR-310 Support
---

Version 9.4.1208 of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver (pgjdbc) just shipped. This is the first version .


| PostgreSQLâ„¢                    | Java SE 8     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| DATE                           | LocalDate     |
| TIME [ WITHOUT TIMEZONE ]      | LocalTime     |
| TIMESTAMP [ WITHOUT TIMEZONE ] | LocalDateTime |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE        | OffsetTime    |


This is closely aligned with tables B-4 and B-5 of the JDBC 4.2 specification. Note that `ZonedDateTime`, `Instant` and `OffsetTime / TIME [ WITHOUT TIMEZONE ]` are not supported. Also note that all `OffsetTime` will instances will have be in UTC (have offset 0). This is because the backend stores them as UTC.

```java
try (Statement st = conn.createStatement();  
    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE columnfoo = 500")) {
    while (rs.next()) {
        LocalDate localDate = rs.getObject(1, LocalDate.class));
        System.out.println(localDate);
    }
}
```


The PostgreSQL driver documentation should soon be updated to reflect this.
