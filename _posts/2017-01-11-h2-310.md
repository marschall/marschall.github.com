title: H2 now has JSR-310 Support
---

Version [1.4.193](https://www.h2database.com/html/changelog.html) of [H2 database](https://h2database.com) shipped some weeks ago. This is the first version to support [JSR-310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310) with JDBC 4.2. The supported JSR-310 data types are:


| H2                             | Java SE 8     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| DATE                           | LocalDate     |
| TIME [ WITHOUT TIMEZONE ]      | LocalTime     |
| TIMESTAMP [ WITHOUT TIMEZONE ] | LocalDateTime |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE        | OffsetTime    |


This is closely aligned with tables B-4 and B-5 of the JDBC 4.2 specification. Note that `ZonedDateTime`, `Instant` and `OffsetTime / TIME [ WITHOUT TIMEZONE ]` are not supported. The syntax [does not follow the SQL standard](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/411). `LocalTime` also has nanosecond resolution.

You can use the API like this:

```java
try (Statement st = conn.createStatement();  
    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE columnfoo = 500")) {
    while (rs.next()) {
        LocalDate localDate = rs.getObject(1, LocalDate.class);
        System.out.println(localDate);
    }
}
```

If you're using Maven the coordinates are:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.193</version>
</dependency>
```

Due to a bug fixed in 1.4.194 (not yet released) you also need

```xml
 <dependency>
  <groupId>com.vividsolutions</groupId>
  <artifactId>jts-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.14.0</version>
</dependency>
```
